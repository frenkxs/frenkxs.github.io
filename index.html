        The Olympic games started off as a men-only event. The first female athletes competed in the second Olympic games in 1900 in Paris. From then on, the number of women's disciplines has been continuously growing (although never exceeding or meeting the number of men's disciplines).

        The growth, however, varied for different sports. It was 'quick and easy' in swimming, but it took until the 2000s for women to reach a comparable number of disciplines in athletics. It had taken nearly 80 years to introduce women's rowing, but once it happened, it happened quickly. Quite the opposite happened to female kayakers and canoeists: they have been in the olympics programme since the 1940s, but are poorly represented to this day.

      <p>
        There have always been disciplines open exclusively to men or women. Their number has been decreasing over the years, but they are still with us. Needless to say, there have always been more men-only disciplines than women-only ones.

        On the opposite sides are open and mixed disciplines where men and women compete together, either in pairs (mixed doubles in tennis or badminton), or regardless of gender. The true (and only) champion is equestrianism (horseback riding) which has seen increasing nubmer of women champions in recent years.
